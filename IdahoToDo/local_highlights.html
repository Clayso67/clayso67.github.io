        <p>I've lived in Idaho for most of my life and one of  my favorite things to do with friends is to go to the sand dunes and start a bonfire. It's always fun to listen to music and roast marshmallows while just having a fun laid-back time with my friends. </p>

        <h3>Hi! I'm Eileen Stephens,</h3>
        <p>If you're bored and looking for something to do in the area pretty close to Rexburg there is an awesome hike just outside Driggs to a gorgeous lake called Packsaddle. This is the perfect place to visit in the summertime while it's hot because the water is always nice and cool! It's a great place to have a picnic. You could rent paddle boards at the ORC to go out on the lake. Everyone that goes to Packsaddle loves to take a turn on the rope swing, so make sure to bring your suit!</p>

        <h3>My name is Jordan Hansen,</h3>
        <p>Last semester me and my  roommates climbed Mount Borah! The tallest mountain in Idaho. It took a little bit of planning but you can find lots of resources about the hike online and even watch YouTube videos. We're able to do it in a day, and the view was awesome! </p></section>
